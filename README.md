This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: array index out of bounds.  The `bug.swift` file contains code that attempts to access an element of an array using an invalid index, resulting in a runtime crash.  The solution, in `bugSolution.swift`, shows how to prevent this error using safe array access techniques.
